# Random Name Picker for GitHub prize draw at RenderATL 2023!

![banner-code-graph](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36594527/205007944-531bd076-1b9b-4f9b-b0eb-ddf284e2d243.png)

:pray: First, huge shout-out to [@icelam](https://github.com/icelam) for a great and simple name picker we could fork and use for the GitHub booth!

:rocket: This site is deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The Actions workflow pulls entrants from commenters of a GitHub Issue.

:ticket: To enter the draw, add a comment at the bottom of this issue üëá 

## üèÜ  The prize will be drawn on Friday, time TBC.

A couple of T&C's:

- Entry into this raffle will NOT constitute your consent to be contacted for anything else
- We will not be adding you to our marketing database (but if you want to subscribe to our newsletter, [you can do so here](https://resources.github.com/newsletter/))
- The raffle prize cannot be swapped or changed, 
- The winner of the prize at RenderATL *MUST* be present when we draw a winner, otherwise we will redraw!

Good luck!
